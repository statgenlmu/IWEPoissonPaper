IWEinference is a MCMC application where mouse cell methylation data is used to infer logarithms of the length of branches,
logarithms of the shape parameter of the gamma distribution of rate acceleration factors, logarithm of the rate of methylation events,
and presence of those along edges in the model I detailed in my reprot recently. 

Every thousand MCMC steps the program outputs into the folowing files:
log_branch_length.param (contains the logarithms of the branch lengths in each line, the order is given bellow where the cell names are)
log_pcrate.param (contains the logarithms of the probability change rate in each line)
log_shape.param (contains the logarithms of the shape parameter of the gamma distribution in each line)
n_iter.param (contains the number of iterations)
rate_acc.param (contains the rate accelerations derived from the shape parameter for easier viewing)
n_affected_islands.param (gives the number of affected islands for each branch.
npc.param (Gives the number of IWEs in each branch.)
pc_change_info.param (Gives detailed information about the contained IWEs in each branch)

The input that must be specified are the methylation states in each island for each cell type. 
These must be written into files with the name CPG_ISLANDS_[name of cell type].txt
Here [name of cell type] stands for the abbreviated name of the cell type in question.

The cell type names are:
HSC MPP1 MPP2 CLP CD4 CD8 B_cell CMP MEP Eryth GMP Granu Mono

This is also the sequence the log branch lengths are given in.

Each file with a celltype should contain the methylation information of that cell in the following way:
Each line represents a cpg island. The sequence of the cpg island consists of the following characters:
0 
1
2
N or ?

0 stands for unmethylated
1 stands for partially methylated
2 stands for fullymethylated
N or ? stands for non available

Commandline options:

If the program is invoked without commandline options it performs estimation of all parameters a tree ressembling the hematopoietic cell lines starting from the mean values of the prior distirbutions.
This can be influenced via command line options:

-disable_modes followed by string of numbers disables inference for the respective paramter and the MCMC chain remains at the starting value.

Modes are:

 * 0 corresponds to sampling of new log branch lengths.
 * 1 corresponds to sampling of new log shape params.
 * 2 corresponds to sampling of new log IWE rates.
 * 3 corresponds to sampling of new events.
 * 4 corresponds to sampling of new invariant probabilities.
 * 5 corresponds to sampling of new probabilites in the root.


Strting values can be set by invoking

-set_log_pcrate for the logarithm of the IWErate.
-set_log_shape for the logarithm of the shape parameter.
-set_invp for the invariant probability.

Each of these options should be followed by a number.

While the default topology is that of the mouse hematopoietic line, another tree can be used by invoking

-use_custom_tree [tree]

where [tree is that tree in Newick notation.

One can set custom starting IWEs via

-use_custom_transitions

If one wants to this one needs to provide a file called p_change_info.sol containing IWEs in the same format as p_change_info.param.
