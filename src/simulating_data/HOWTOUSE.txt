This tool generates sequences in each node in each tree for a tree according to the methylation model
specified in paper name.

To specify the size of the sequence use the command line option

 -island_sizes  followed by unsinged island sizes,

which describe the number of CPGsites in each island.

To specify parameters used the following command line options are available:

 -log_branch_length followed by 13 log branch lengths which are double, to specify the branch length. This option is obsolete if custom trees are used.
 -log_shape, follwoed by a single double variable for the logarith, of the shape parameter
 -log_pc_rate followed by a single double variable for the logarithm of the IWE rate.
 -p_inv followed by single double between 0 and 1 for the rate of invariant sites.

If using the default tree the order the branch lengths are given in is given by:
HSC MPP1 MPP2 CLP CD4 CD8 B_cell CMP MEP Eryth GMP Granu Mono


If you want to use a custom tree, invoke

-use_custom_tree [tree]

where [tree] is a Newick string with specified branch lengths.


Output of sequences is written into files with the name CPG_ISLANDS_[name of cell type].txt
Here [name of cell type] stands for the abbreviated name of the cell type in question.

The cell type names are:
HSC MPP1 MPP2 CLP CD4 CD8 B_cell CMP MEP Eryth GMP Granu Mono

if using the default tree, or are specified within in the Newick tring if using a custom tree.

Each file with a celltype should contain the methylation information of that cell in the following way:
Each line represents a cpg island. The sequence of the cpg island consists of the following characters:
0 
1
2


0 stands for unmethylated
1 stands for partially methylated
2 stands for fullymethylated


Additional output are the input parameters used which are given out in target_params.target
and the IWEs simulated during the run which are given out in target_p_change_info.txt.
